		<English>[TAB]Uyghur history is the story of an obscure nomadic tribe from the Altai Mountains rising to challenge the Chinese Empire and ultimately becoming the diplomatic arm of the Mongol invasion. The ancestors of the Uyghur include the nomadic Gaoche people and possibly the Tocharian peoples of the Tarim Basin. The Uyghur participated in a coalition of Tiele under the leadership of the Syr-Tardush tribe, who allied with the Chinese Sui Empire in 603 to defeat Tardu Khan and win their independence. In 744 the Uyghur, together with other related subject tribes (the Basmil and Qarluq), defeated the Gokturk Khanate and founded the Uyghur Empire at Mount Ötüken, which lasted for about 100 years.</English>
