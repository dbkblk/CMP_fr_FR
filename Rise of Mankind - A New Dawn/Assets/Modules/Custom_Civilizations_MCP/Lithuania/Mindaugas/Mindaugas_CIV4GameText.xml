		<English>[H1]Mindaugas[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of Lithuania[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] c.1203 - 1263[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]A man of strong character amongst five established grand dukes, Mindaugas was able to win personal power in Lithuania and turned his sight to the Ruthenian lands, where he conquered vast areas. On July 6, 1253 Mindaugas was crowned King of Lithuania. There are only a few probable locations for his coronation: Vilnius, legendary Voruta (Mindaugas stayed here during the civil war in 1251, but its location is still unknown) or Trakai (Old Trakai). It is only known that Mindaugas and his wife Morta were crowned by the order of Pope Innocent IV, and that for this occasion a Catholic church was built.[PARAGRAPH:1]On September 12th of 1263, Mindaugas was killed (with his 2 younger sons) by his nephews Treniota and Daumantas (the latter was duke of Nalšia). Under the usurper Treniota, a person of strong pagan beliefs, the country relapsed into paganism until the re-conversion in 1386 by Grand Duke Jogaila.[PARAGRAPH:1]Only with Gediminas, Grand Duke from 1316, did Lithuania's revival as a European power began. While most of the Lithuanian Grand Dukes from Jogaila onward reigned also as Kings of Poland, their titles remained separate, and Mindaugas was the only King of Lithuania, recognized as such by Western European rulers.</English>
