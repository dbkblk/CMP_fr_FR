		<French>[H1]Enrico Dandolo[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Doge de la République Sérénissime (Venise)[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Dates : [\BOLD] 1107? - 1205[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Biographie :[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]On se souvient d'abord de lui pour son rôle lors de la 4ème croisade qui finit par conquérir Constantinople et qui mit fin à l'Empire Byzantin.[PARAGRAPH:1]Il devint le 39ème doge de Venise le 1er janvier 1193. Dandolo était déjà vieux et aveugle, mais profondément ambitieux, et montrait un esprit sensationnel et une remarquable force physique (pour son âge). Il avait effectivement au moins 70 ans lorsqu'il devint doge et certains affirment qu'il avait déjà 85 ans. Ses actions remarquables lors de ses 11 années de règne mirent cependant de coté son âge. En 1202, les chevaliers de la 4ème croisade furent coincés à Venise, incapable de payer pour les navires qu'ils avaient demandés après que des troupes beaucoup moins nombreuses que prévues à cause du sabotage en interne de l'opération par les Vénitiens. Dandolo proposa un plan qui permettait aux croisés de suspendre leur dette à condition que ceux-ci aidassent les Vénitiens à reprendre le contrôle de Zara, toute proche. A une émouvante et enthousiaste cérémonie sur la place San Marco à Venise, Dandolo "prit la croix" (devenant lui même croisé) et fut aussitôt rejoint par des milliers d'autres Vénitiens. Dandolo devint un important leader de la croisade.[PARAGRAPH:1]Venise fut le principal pourvoyeur financier de la 4ème croisade, fournissant les navires et prêtant de l'argent aux croisés qui devinrent lourdement débiteurs de Venise. A cause des nombreux retards des croisés, les provisions devinrent aussi un problème pour l'entreprise.[PARAGRAPH:1]Bien qu'ils devaient naviguer vers l'Egypte, Dandolo les convint de s'arrêter à Zara, une cité portuaire de l'Adriatique dont Venise et le royaume de Hongrie proclamaient tous les deux leur souveraineté dessus. Dandolo encouragea les croisés à attaquer la ville qui se rebellait contre Venise. Un petit nombre de croisés refusèrent d'aider, mais les autres réalisèrent que la conquête de la cité rebelle et qu'un hivernage ici était la seule manière de garder unis les croisés. Zara fut assiégée et capturée le 15 novembre 1202.[PARAGRAPH:1]Peu de temps après, Alexis Ange, fils de l'empereur byzantin destitué Isaac II, arriva dans la ville. Dandolo accepta de suivre le plan des autres chefs croisés et de replacer Alexis Ange sur le trône de l'Empire Byzantin en échange du soutien byzantin à la croisade. Ceci mena finalement à la conquête et au pillage de Constantinople le 13 avril 1204, un évènement auquel Dandolo était présent et dans lequel il joua un grand rôle. Les croisés catholiques prirent alors le contrôle permanent de la capitale orthodoxe de Constantinople (ou Byzance) ainsi que les territoires à l'est et établirent un état catholique, l'Empire Latin de Constantinople. En conclusion de la 4ème croisade, Venise gagna des titres de propriété sur les 3/8 de l'Empire Byzantin. L'Empire Byzantin ne put jamais récupérer son ancienne puissance après la 4ème croisade.</French>
