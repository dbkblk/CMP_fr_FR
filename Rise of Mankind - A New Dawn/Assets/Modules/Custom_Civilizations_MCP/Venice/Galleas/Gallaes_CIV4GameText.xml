		<English>[TAB]The galleass or "galliass" developed from large merchant galleys. Converted for military use they were higher and larger than regular ("light") galleys. They had up to 32 oars, each worked by up to 5 men. They usually had three masts and a forecastle and aftcastle. Much effort was made in Venice to make these galleasses as fast as possible to compete with regular galleys. The gun-deck usually ran over the rowers' heads, but there are also pictures showing the opposite arrangement.[PARAGRAPH:1]	Galleasses usually carried more sails than true galleys, and were far deadlier; a galley caught broadside lay all but helpless, but coming broadside to a galleass, as with a ship of the line, exposed an attacker to her gunfire. The galleass exemplified an intermediate type between the galley and the true man-of-war. Relatively few galleasses were built ? one disadvantage was that, being more reliant on sails, their position at the front of the galley line at the start of a battle could not be guaranteed ? but they were used at the Battle of Lepanto (7 October 1571), their firepower helping to win victory for the Christian fleet, and some sufficiently seaworthy galleasses accompanied the Spanish Armada in 1588 (e.g. La Girona).[PARAGRAPH:1]	In the Mediterranean, with its shallower waters, less dangerous weather and fickle winds, both galleasses and galleys continued in use, particularly in Venice and Turkey, long after they became obsolete elsewhere. Later, "round ships" and galleasses were replaced by galleons and ships of the line which originated in northern Europe. The first Venetian ship of the line was built in 1660.</English>
		<French>[TAB]Les galéasses se développèrent à partir de larges galères marchandes. Converties ensuite à un usage militaire, elles étaient plus hautes et plus larges que les galères "légères" traditionnelles. Elles avaient jusqu'à 32 rames, chacune maniée par jusqu'à 5 hommes. Elles avaient habituellement 3 mats, un poste d'équipage à l'avant et un château arrière. Venise fit beaucoup d'efforts pour rendre ses galéasses aussi rapides que possible pour qu'elles soient aussi compétitives que les galères régulières. Le pont des canons se trouvait habituellement au dessus de la tête des rameurs, mais il existe des images anciennes montrant l'arrangement inverse. [PARAGRAPH:1]Les galéasses disposaient habituellement de plus de voiles que les véritables galères et étaient bien plus mortelles. Une galère prise de flanc n'avait aucune chance, mais venir à flanc d'une galéasse, de la même manière qu'avec un navire de ligne, c'était s'exposer à ses tirs de canons. La galéasse est un intermédiaire entre la galère et le véritable navire de ligne. Peu de galéasses furent construites. Un de leurs désavantages était que, étant tributaire de leurs voiles, leur position devant la ligne de galère au début des batailles ne pouvait être garantie. Elles furent cependant utilisées à la bataille de Lépante (7 octobre 1571), où leur puissance de feu contribua à la victoire de la flotte chrétienne. Certaines galéasses suffisamment en état pour naviguer en haute mer accompagnèrent l'a Grande Armada espagnole en 1588.[PARAGRAPH:1]En Méditerranée, avec ses eaux moins profondes, un temps moins dangereux et des vents changeants, les galéasses et les galères continuèrent à être utilisées, particulièrement par Venise et l'Empire Ottoman, bien longtemps après qu'elles soient devenues obsolètes ailleurs. Plus tard, les caravelles et les galéasses furent remplacées par les galions et les vaisseaux de ligne originaires d'Europe du nord. Le premier navire de ligne vénitien fut construit en 1660.</French>
