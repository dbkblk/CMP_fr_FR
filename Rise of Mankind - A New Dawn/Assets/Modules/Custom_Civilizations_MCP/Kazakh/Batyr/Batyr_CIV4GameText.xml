		<English>[TAB]Baghatur is an old Altaic term for a warrior, a military commander, or an epic hero. The word was introduced in the Middle Ages to many non-Altaic languages by conquering Turkic- and Mongol-speaking nomads, and now exists in different forms such as the Russian Bogatyr', Polish Bohater (meaning hero), Persian and North Indian Bahadur, and Georgian Bagatur. It is also preserved in the modern Turkic and Mongol languages as Turkish Batur, Tatar and Kazakh Batyr, Uzbek Batyr and Mongolian Baatar (as in Ulaanbaatar).</English>
