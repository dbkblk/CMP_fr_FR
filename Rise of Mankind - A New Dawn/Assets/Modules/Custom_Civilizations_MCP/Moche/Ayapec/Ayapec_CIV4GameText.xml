		<English>[H1]Lord of Sipan[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Ruler of the Moche[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD]c. 200 - 250[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]The Lord of Sipan tomb is a Moche culture site in Peru. Some archaeologists hold it to be one of the most important archaeological discoveries in this region of the world in the last 30 years, because the main tomb was found intact and untouched by thieves. Sipan is located in the northern part of Peru, close to the coast, in the middle of the Lambayeque Valley, 35 km east of Chiclayo, Peru. Four tombs have been found in Sipán's Huaca Rajada, a mausoleum built by the Moche culture that ruled the northern coast of Peru from around 1 AD to 700 AD.[PARAGRAPH:1]The clothing of this warrior and ruler suggest he was approximately 1.67 m tall. He probably died within three months of governing. His jewelry and ornaments which indicate he was of the highest rank, include pectoral, necklaces, nose rings, ear rings, helmets, falconry and bracelets. Most were of gold, silver, copper, gold and semi-precious stones. In his tomb were found more than 400 jewels.[PARAGRAPH:1]Found on the Lord of Sipan, was a precious necklace with beads of gold and silver in the shape of maní, or peanut kernels to represent the tierra, the earth. The peanut kernels represented the earth to signify that man came from the land, and that when they die, they return back to the earth; the Moches harvested peanuts and knew that they came from the ground, therefore they were symbolic. The necklace itself has 10 kernels to the right that are gold which signifies masculinity and the sun god, while the kernels that are located on the left side are silver to represent femininity and the moon god.[PARAGRAPH:1]Because of his high rank this ruler was buried along with eight people, apparently his wife and two other women (possibly concubines), a military commander, a watchman, a banner holder and a child. Among the animals found was a dog. Below the tomb of the Lord of Sipan, two other tombs were found, a priest and the Old Lord of Sipan.[PARAGRAPH:1]The priest, by DNA analysis carried out, was contemporary with the Lord of Sipan. In the pieces that accompanied him stand out as religious symbols, the cup or bowl for the sacrifices, a metal crown adorned with an owl with its wings extended, and other items for worship of the moon.</English>
