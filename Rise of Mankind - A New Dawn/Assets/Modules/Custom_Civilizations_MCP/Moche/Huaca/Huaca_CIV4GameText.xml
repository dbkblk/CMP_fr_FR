		<English>[TAB]In Quechua, a Native American language of South America, a huaca or wak'a is an object that represents something revered, typically a monument of some kind. The term huaca can refer to natural locations, such as immense rocks. Some huacas have been associated with veneration and ritual. Andean cultures believed every object has a physical presence and two camaquen (spirits), one to create it and another to animate it.

Impressive ziggurats can be found in a number of Moche sites. </English>
