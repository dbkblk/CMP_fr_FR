		<English>[TAB]Salegy is the best-known and most widely exported dance pop music of Madagascar. It began in northern coastal towns like Majunga, Nosy Be and Diego Suarez (Antsiranana). Salegy is driving, 12/8 music with clear affinities to mainland Afropop styles in places like Zimbabwe and Mozambique. It is characterized by gently rippling guitar work, organ or keyboards and sometimes accordion, and powerful vocal armonies.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The style originated with Malagasy folk songs, often sung during moonlight feasts. But as in the birth sagas of so many 20th century roots pop styles, pioneering musicians also needed to get an education in foreign music. As international pop styles, and music technology seeped into this remote, local scene, salegy pop emerged, and was being widely recorded by the 1950s and 60s. It evolved to feature rich, harmonized vocals and chiming guitar lines locked, restless, animated 12/8 rhythms. There is also a calmer, more romantic genre of the music, known as malesa.</English>
