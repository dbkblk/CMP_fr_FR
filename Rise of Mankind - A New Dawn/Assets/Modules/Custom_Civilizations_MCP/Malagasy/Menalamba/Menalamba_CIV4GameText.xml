		<English>[TAB]The rising of the menalamba, the Red Shawls, was a revolt against French colonial rule in Madagascar in the 1890s. In the century before the French conquest, rising tensions between modernising kings, self-seeking Christian oligarchs and reactionary guardians of the ancient talismans had weakened the capacity of the kingdom to resist. But just two months after the French occupation of the capital the menalamba revivalist movement sought to restore the customs of the ancestors and expel the French from the island. The civil war of 1895 fully described here for the first time, has cast a shadow on Malagasy politics ever since.</English>
