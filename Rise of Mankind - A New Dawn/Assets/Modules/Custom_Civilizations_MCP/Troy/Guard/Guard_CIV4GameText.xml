		<English>[TAB]The Apollonian Guard was a unit of the Trojan Army, named after the largest and most important gate of Troy, the Apallonian Gate, and were noted as some of the greatest and most experienced soldiers of the Trojans. These soldiers were usually put into the front-line of battles, and were noted to be a unit of perfection in javelin-throwing and horse-riding. They were led solely by Poludamas, an important general and military advisor of King Priam, and a lueitenant and friend of Hector. Much of the unit was destroyed in the first battle of the Trojan War, when Hector and Poludamas led the Apallonian Guard against Achilles and his elite soldiers when they raided the Grand Temple of Apollo, the patron god of Troy. The rest were wiped out in a final stand at the Citadel of Troy, the area were the palace, temples and the Towers of Ilium laid. There Poludamas died, seven days after Hector's death at the hands of Achilles, and directly before Paris, also known as Alexandros, killed Achilles in the Gardens of Troy, and then was killed in combat, then afterwards Helen did a whorish act, and took of her top to seduce King Meneleus of Sparta, her ex-husband, to spare her.</English>
