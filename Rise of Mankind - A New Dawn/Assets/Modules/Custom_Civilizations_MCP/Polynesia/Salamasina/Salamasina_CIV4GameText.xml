		<English>[H1]Salamasina[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Queen of Samoa[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] c.1550 - ? [NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Queen Salamasina was the first sovereign ruler of Samoa, she was descended from the Kings of Tonga, the High Chiefs of Samoa and Fiji. She was the first female to attain all of the four paramount royal titles and become the tafaifa or supreme monarch of Samoa. She reigned for nearly 10 decades of peace after many civil wars and disputes with neighbouring Tonga. It is believed she was the daughter of Nafanua, the goddess of War who predicted Christianity arriving in Samoa. Not much is known about her, but the present sovereign ruler of Samoa, His Royal Highness Malietoa Tanumafili II is a direct descendent of this legendary queen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Approximately 550 years after Lady Murasaki's courageous writings, in 1550, was born Salamasina, the Samoan/Tongan female destined to hold not one or two titles but an unheard of four! When Salamasina was a little girl, she was made Tupu O Samoa or the Supreme Ruler of Samoa and was queen of Upolu, Savai'i, and Tutuila islands. As a young woman, she surrendered her love for the untitled Alapepe and married instead Tapumanaia to preserve peace in Samoa.[PARAGRAPH:1]Queen Salamasina was kind, just, and skillful in leading her country, making great effort and sacrifice to ensure peace for all. During her 40 years reign, there were no wars and people prospered and were happy. Queen Salamasina made great strides as an advocate for women's concerns by encouraging them to make tapa cloth and fine mats. She also believed that the young adults should have the freedom to choose their spouses and encouraged parents to refrain from the norm of arranged marriages. Furthermore, she took on the powerful tulafales or talking chiefs and worked hard to curb their power to forcefully persuade a chief to marry many times, which ultimately resulted in the talking chiefs receiving many fine mats and other wealth.[PARAGRAPH:1]Due to Queen Salamasina's benevolence and leadership, the marriages of her chiefs stabilized, her people enjoyed peace, and the arts fluorished. Were it not for Queen Salamasina, perhaps marriages in Samoa today would still be arranged.</English>
