		<English>[TAB]The word braaivleis (pronounced "bry-flays") is Afrikaans for "roasted meat". The word braai (pronounced "bry", rhyming with the word "cry") is Afrikaans for "barbecue" or "roast" and is a social custom in South Africa and Zimbabwe. It originated with the Afrikaner people, but has since been adopted by South Africans of many ethnic backgrounds. The word vleis is Afrikaans for "meat", so in this word, the "s" is not a plural.</English>
