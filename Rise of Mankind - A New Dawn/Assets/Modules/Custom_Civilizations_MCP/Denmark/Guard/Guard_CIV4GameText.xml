		<English>[TAB]Although the Guard Hussars (Gardehusarregimentet) themselves date from 1762, the Danish Army takes the date of the founding of a regiment from its oldest part, in this case the Zealand Life Regiment, which was founded in 1614. This makes the Guard Hussars the oldest regiment of hussars in the world still operational. In addition to its operational role, the Guard Hussar Regiment is one of two regiments in the Danish Army (along with the Den Kongelige Livgarde) to be classed as 'Guards'; in this case, the Guard Hussars perform the same role as the Household Cavalry do in the British Army. The ceremonial uniform of the Guard Hussar Regiment dates from 1860.[PARAGRAPH:1]The motto of the regiment is not in Danish but in Latin: In actis esto volucris, which translates to Be swift in action.</English>
