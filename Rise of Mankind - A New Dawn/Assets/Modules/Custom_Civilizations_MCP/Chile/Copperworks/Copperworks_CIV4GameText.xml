		<English>[TAB]Copper has played a large role in the Chilean economy since at least 1825, when British and Americans were already competingwith other foreign investors to control Chile's copper and silver market.  By 1835, Chile was exporting 12,700 tons of copper a year, much of it to the United States.  Copper accounted for fifty-five per cent of the country's economy by 1860.  Chile became highly dependent upon its copper exports. After the War of the Pacific (1879-83), the quantity of copper that Chile mined continued to skyrocket.  Although the demand for copper put Chile way ahead of other nations in the region, its increasing dependence on copper put it at the mercy of the world market.</English>
