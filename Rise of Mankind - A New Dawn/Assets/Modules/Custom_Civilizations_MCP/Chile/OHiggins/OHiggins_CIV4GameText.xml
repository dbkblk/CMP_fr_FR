		<English>[H1]Bernardo O'Higgins[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Supreme Director of Chile[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] 1778 - 1842[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:1][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Bernardo O'Higgins Riquelme, South American independence leader, was one of the commanders - together with Jose de San Martin - of the military forces that freed Chile from Spanish rule in the Chilean War of Independence. Although he was the third Supreme Director of Chile (1817-23), O'Higgins was the first holder of this title to head a fully independent Chilean state. When his father Ambrose O'Higgins became Viceroy of Peru, Bernardo was sent to a Catholic school in London to complete his studies.There, Bernardo became acquainted with American-independist ideas: he knew Venezuelan Francisco de Miranda and joined the Masonic Logia Lautaro.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1810, he joined the nationalist rebels fighting for independence from Spain. In 1814, his Chilean rebels were defeated by the Spanish and retreated into the Andes. In 1817, O'Higgins went back on the offensive with the aid of Argentine General José de San Martín. On February 12, 1817, he led a cavalry charge that won the Battle of Chacabuco. He became the first leader of independent Chile, and was granted dictatorial powers as Supreme Director on February 16, 1817. On February 12, 1818, Chile was proclaimed an independent republic.[PARAGRAPH:1]His six-year rule saw the founding of the Military Academy and the approval of the new (and current) Chilean flag. However, his more radical and liberal reforms, (such as the establishment of democracy and abolition of nobility titles) were resisted by the powerful conservative large-land owners. During his government, he founded the cities of La Union and Vicuna. From his later exile in Peru, he promoted the Chilean expansion southward, concluding in the foundation of Punta Arenas in 1845. Also, his government was involved in the killing of adversary independist leaders Jose Miguel Carrera, his brothers Juan José and Luis in Argentina, and Carreras' friend and guerrilla leader Manuel Rodriguez. He was deposed by a conservative coup on January 28, 1823.[PARAGRAPH:1]During his government, he also assisted Jose de San Martin to organize the Expedition and an Army and Navy to support the Independence of Peru. He also organized the Chilean Army and the first Chilean Navy, under the command of Lord Cochrane and Manuel Blanco Encalada.</English>
