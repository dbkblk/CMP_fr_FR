		<English>[H1]Augusto José Ramón Pinochet Ugarte[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]President of Chile[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD]1915 - 2006[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Augusto José Ramón Pinochet Ugarte was a Chilean military officer and dictator. He was the leader of the Government Junta of Chile from 1973 to 1974 and President of Chile from 1974 until the return of democratic rule in 1990. From the beginning, the military government led by Pinochet implemented harsh measures against its political opponents, which included systematic suspensions of civil liberties and violations of human rights and for which he faced several criminal indictments beginning in 1998 until his death in 2006. At the time of his death he had not been convicted of any crimes, although investigations were ongoing.[PARAGRAPH:1]The military government also implemented economic reforms, including the privatization of several state controlled industries and the rollback of many state welfare institutions. These policies were initially very successful in recovering economic growth, and are often called el milagro económico ("the economic miracle") of the military regime in Chile, but they dramatically increased inequality and some attribute the devastating effect of the 1982 monetary crisis in the Chilean economy to these policies.[PARAGRAPH:1]On September 11, 1973, Pinochet, who twenty days before had been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Chilean Army by socialist President Salvador Allende, led a coup d'état which put an end to Allende's government, and, along with the Navy, Air Force and Carabineros (a national police force), established a military dictatorship. With active support from the CIA Pinochet implemented a series of military operations in which (according to the 1993 Rettig Report) over 3,200 people were killed, while (according to the 2004 Valech Report) at least 80,000 were incarcerated without trials and 30,000 subjected to torture. Another 200,000 people went into exile, particularly in Argentina and Peru, and applied as political refugees; however, some key individuals were followed in their exile by the DINA secret police, in the framework of Operation Condor which linked South American dictatorships together against political opponents.[PARAGRAPH:1]In December 1974, the junta appointed Pinochet as President by a joint decree, to which Air Force General Gustavo Leigh disagreed. The legality of such appointment was confirmed through a highly controversial plebiscite in 1980, which approved a new Constitution drafted by a government-appointed commission. Pinochet remained in power until 1990, after his attempt to stay in power was defeated in the 1988 plebiscite. After stepping down, he continued to serve as Commander in Chief of the Chilean Army until March 10, 1998, when he retired and became a senator-for-life in accordance with the 1980 Constitution.[PARAGRAPH:1]At the time of his death in December 2006, around 300 criminal charges were still pending against him in Chile for human rights abuses (torture, forced disappearance, assassination, etc.), tax evasion and embezzlement under his rule and afterwards in 2006, Pinochet's total wealth was estimated to be at least US$28 million.</English>
