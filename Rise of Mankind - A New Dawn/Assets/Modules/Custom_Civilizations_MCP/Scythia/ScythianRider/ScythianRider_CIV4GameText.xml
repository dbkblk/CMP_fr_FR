		<English>[TAB]These nomadic tribes live for war. War, and horses. A Scythian rider will drink the blood of their first kill as a right of passage. They scalp their victims and wear their skin like handkerchiefs as a sign of status in their tribe. They're even known to flay an entire enemy and use their hide as a cloak, or as a cover for their quivers. In fact, if a Scythian tribesman doesn't make a kill during a given year, they're left out of their main annual ceremony, where warriors drink wine from the gilded skulls of their enemies.</English>
