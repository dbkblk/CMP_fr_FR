		<English>[TAB]The name Mapuche is derived from the "Mapudungo" Mapuche language) words for "Mapu", which means land, and "Che", which means people. In their own language the Mapuche were the people of the land, and also known as Araucanos, a name given to them by the Spanish colonialists the "huincas" (Spanish) arrived in 1541, the Mapuche who numbered one and half to two million were the original inhabitants of the Southern Cone of the continent in a region which today covers half of Chile. The Mapuche nation comprised of both sedentary and nomadic communities: hunters and gatherers, shepherds, farmers and fishermen. They lived in small family groups known as lof, which were under the authority of a Lonko (chief). [PARAGRAPH:2]The Mapuche territory had its border with the Inca Empire south of the Maule river. This border was established after a long war and the failure of the Inca to conquer the Mapuche nation by the use of force. The Mapuche territory is divided into four main regions or wallmapus. These are known as: Puelmapu (land of the east), Pikunmapu (land of the north), Lafquenmapu (land of the Pacific coastal region in the west) and Huillimapu (land of the south). Therefore the Mapuche of those regions are identified accordingly, such as Puelche, Pikunche, Lafquenche, Huilliche. There are, however, other areas in which the Mapuche are known by their association with a particular eco-system or natural environment, for example Pewenche (people of the monkey puzzle tree) region, Waidefche (people from the cordillera), Ranquilche (people from the apple tree region), etc. Before the colonialists arrived the Mapuche people had and still have a distintive cultural identity, social organisation, language, religion and way of life. Inhabiting such a vast area the Mapuche had developed regional cultural diversity without a centralized power, but they nevertheless had a strong sense of unity. Their clear sense of nationhood and an unquestionable desire to maintain their self-determination and freedom, forced them into armed resistance, firstly against the Inca Empire and then for over 400 years against the Spanish, Chileans and Argentinians.</English>
