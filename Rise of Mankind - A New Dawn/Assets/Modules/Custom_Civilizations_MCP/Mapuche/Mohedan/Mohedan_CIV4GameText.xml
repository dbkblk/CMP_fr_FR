		<English>[TAB]Toqui (Mapudungun for axe or axe-bearer) is a title conferred by the Mapuche  (an indigenous Chilean people) to those who are chosen as their leaders during times of war. The toqui is chosen in an assembly or parliament (coyag), of the chiefs (loncos) of the various clans (Rehues) or confederation of clans (Aillarehues), allied during the war in question. The Toqui could command strict obedience of all the warriors and their loncos during the war, organize them in units and appoint leaders over them. This command would continue until toqui was killed, deposed in another parliament (as in the case of Lincoyan, for poor leadership), or upon completion of the war for which he was chosen.  Some of the more famous Toqui in the Arauco War with the Spanish introduced tactical innovations; for instance, Lautaro introduced infantry tactics to defeat horsemen. Lemucaguin was the first Toqui to use firearms and artillery in battle. Nongoniel was the first Toqui to use cavalry with the Mapuche army. Cadeguala was the first to successfully use Mapuche cavarly to defeat Spanish cavalry in battle. Anganamón was the first to mount his infantry to keep up with his fast moving cavalry. Lientur pioneered the tactic of numerous and rapid malóns into Spanish territory.</English>
