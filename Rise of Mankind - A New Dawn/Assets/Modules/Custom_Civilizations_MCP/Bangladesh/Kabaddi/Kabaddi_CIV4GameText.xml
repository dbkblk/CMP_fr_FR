		<English>[TAB]Kabaddi is a combative team game, played with absolutely no equipment, in a rectangular court, either out-doors -or indoors with seven players on the ground in each side. Each -side takes alternate chances at offence and defense. The basic idea of the game is to score points by raiding into the opponents court and touching as many defense players as possible without getting caught on a single breath. During play, the players on the defensive side are called "Antis" while the player of the offense is called the "Raider". Kabaddi is perhaps the only combative sport in which attack is an individual attempt while defense is a group effort.</English>
