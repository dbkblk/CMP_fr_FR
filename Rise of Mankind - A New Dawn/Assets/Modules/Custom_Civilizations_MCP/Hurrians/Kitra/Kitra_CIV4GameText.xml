		<English>[H1]Kitra[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Hurrian King, Founder of the Mitanni Dynasty[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] c. 1500 BC[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Hurrian King, Founder of the Mitanni Dynasty.  Kirta is a legendary Hurrian king. He is thought to have founded the dynasty of Mitanni, but no contemporary inscriptions from his time are known to exist. He may have lived around 1500 BC.

The Epic of Keret from the clay tablets of Ugarit tells the story of the near-extinction of the royal house of Keret. All of his children died and his wife "departed." In a dream, the creator god, El, instructs him to appeal for help from the rain god, Baal, and then launch an expedition to find a new wife. He journeys and on the way comes to the shrine of the goddess Asherah. He promises to give the goddess an offering of a golden statue if he finds a wife. Kirta finds a wife and has several children, but forgets his promise to Asherah. Asherah punishes Kirta with a debilitating illness, but El once again comes to the rescue. His other children are happy to have him back on the throne, but his eldest son, Yassib, attempts to overtake it. Kirta curses him, and there the text ends.</English>
