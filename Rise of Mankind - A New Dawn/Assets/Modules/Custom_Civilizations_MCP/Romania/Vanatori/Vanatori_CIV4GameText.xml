		<English>[TAB]The Mountain Hunters are one of the oldest types of units in the Romanian military. This is an "infantry with special abilities" branch and it is dedicated to mountain warfare.[NEWLINE][TAB] The Mountain Hunters do not consider themselves "special forces". "We like others to call us that way", said Lt-Col Cristinel Cernea, commander of the 21st battalion, 2nd Brigade, the most elite Mountain Hunters battalion in the country. The Mountain Hunters are locally called Vanatori de Munte, or VM's for short.[NEWLINE][TAB]On the 3rd of November, 1916, the 1st Mountain Corps was established, opening a very important chapter in the history of this elite branch.  This event was remembered on the 3rd of November 2001, when the Mountain Hunters celebrated 85 years of existence.  The elite branch of the infantry existed in the past as well, however it was in 1916 when they started to be called "Vanatori de Munte" (Mountain Hunters) and when their main purpose was set to be fighting in mountainous regions.</English>
