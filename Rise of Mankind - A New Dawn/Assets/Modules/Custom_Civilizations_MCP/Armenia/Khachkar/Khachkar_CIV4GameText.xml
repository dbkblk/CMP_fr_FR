		<English>[TAB]Armenian khachkars are a unique part of the national heritage. Intricately decorated crosses are carved on monolithic rocks. There are over 4,000 khachkars in Armenia, and every one of them has a singular pattern. Over time they evolved into an incredibly ornate form which reached its peak in the 12-13th centuries.[PARAGRAPH:1]Khachkars are most commonly used as tombstones, but were sometimes used as memorials. The biggest khachkar cemetery in Armenia is the Noratus Cemetery, while the biggest in the world is in Jugha, in Nakhichevan.[PARAGRAPH:1]Most khachkars do not depict Christ on the cross, but a few notable exceptions exist.[PARAGRAPH:1]</English>
