		<English>[H1]Bayint Naung[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of Toungoo[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] c.1520 - 1581 [NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]King Bayint Naung was not only considered the great king of Burma but also a legendary ruler in Southeast Asias popular history. He is mentioned in Thai literature. The king of the Toungoo dynasty (reigned 1551-81) in Myanmar. He unified his country and conquered the Shan States and Siam (now Thailand), making Myanmar the most powerful kingdom in mainland Southeast Asia.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1550 a revolt broke out among the Mons of southern Myanmar, and Bayint Naung's brother-in-law, Tabinshwehti, was assassinated at Pegu in 1551 by a Mon prince. Bayint Naung marched to Toungoo, eliminated a pretender to the throne, and proclaimed himself king; then he marched south, captured the city of Pegu, and executed the rebel leader, Smim Htaw. The other Mon rulers then surrendered, and the revolt was at an end. Bayint Naung made Pegu his capital, as Tabinshwehti had. He later captured the Siamese capital of Ayutthaya and brought the Siamese royal family to Myanmar as hostages. Bayint Naung was the king whose army razed Ayutthaya. Some historical accounts say his savage invasion was provoked by the king of  Siam's refusal to gift him a white elephant.[PARAGRAPH:1]Bayint Naung was a patron of Buddhism; he built pagodas, gave generous donations to monasteries, and maintained extensive diplomatic relations with the Buddhist kingdom of Ceylon. Another great pagoda in Bago is Mahaceti built by Bayinnaung, most probably the wealthiest king in Myanmar history. According to historical records, fabulous treasures including the life-size gold statues of the extended imperial family were enshrined in it in addition to the usual sacred relics. Whether these treasures still remain intact inside the pagoda is a million dollar question. The sad fact is that the pagoda had lain in ruins for centuries before it was restored to its old grandeur recently. When Pegu was burned in a Mon revolt in 1564, he rebuilt it on an even grander scale, making one of the richest cities in Southeast Asia.</English>
