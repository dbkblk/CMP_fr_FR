		<English>[TAB]A bora ring is a cultural site important to Indigenous Australians. Bora rings are circles of foot-hardened earth surrounded by raised embankments. They were generally constructed in pairs (although some sites have three), with a bigger circle about 22 metres in diameter and a smaller one of about 14 metres. The rings are joined by a sacred walkway. The rings were used in ceremonies, particularly for initiation. They are named for the belt worn by initiated tribesmen.</English>
