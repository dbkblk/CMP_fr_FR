		<English>[TAB]A charreada is a Mexican-style rodeo that is different from other rodeos. The Mexican cowboy or cowgirl is known as a charro or charra. In an American rodeo the competitors race against the clock, so the emphasis is on speed in any given event. On the other hand, in a Mexican charreada the excellent style and skills of the rider or roper are emphasized, and only one event is timed.[PARAGRAPH:1]Charrería (a word encompassing all aspects of the art) came to Mexico from Salamanca, Spain, in the 16th century. Interesting is the fact that when the Spaniards first settled in Mexico they were under the orders of the ruler to raise horses, but not to allow the Mexicans to ride them. By 1528 the Spaniards had very large cattle-raising estates. They soon found it necessary to employ the Mexicans as vaqueros or herdsman, and the natives soon became excellent horsemen. Small landholders, known as rancheros or ranchers, were the first genuine charros and invented charreadas.[PARAGRAPH:1]</English>
