		<English>The Tupi people are one of the main ethnic groups of Brazilian indigenous people, together with the related Guarani. They first inhabited the Amazon rainforest, then spread southward and gradually occupied the Atlantic coast. From the sixteenth century onward the Tupis, like other natives from the region, were assimilated, enslaved or simply exterminated by Portuguese and Spanish settlers, nearly leading to their complete annihilation as a culture, with the exception of a few isolated communities. The remnants of these tribes are today confined to indigenous reservations or acculturated to some degree into the dominant society. In southeastern Brazil they are an important presence in the genetic pool, while constituting a considerable portion of the lower classes in the North, Northeast, and Center-West.[PARAGRAPH:2]Guaraní is the name for a group of culturally related indigenous peoples of South America, distinguished from the related Tupi by their use of the Guarani language. The traditional range of the Guaraní people is between the Uruguay River and lower Paraguay River in what is now Paraguay, the Corrientes and Entre Rios Provinces of Argentina, southern Brazil and parts of Uruguay. There are contemporary Guarani populations in these areas, though their demographic dominance of the region has been reduced by European colonisation and the commensurate rise of the mestizo. Nevertheless, the Guarani language is still widely spoken across traditional Guarani homelands, most notably in Paraguay where it is used amongst all classes and ethnic groups as a symbol of national distinctiveness, and is an official language.[PARAGRAPH:2]The history of the Guarani people prior to contact with European explorers is not well documented. They did not have a written language and their history relied on oral tradition, and as they were a somewhat nomadic and decentralized society there is little in the way of reliable history.[PARAGRAPH:2]Early villages often consisted of communal houses, of ten to fifteen families. Communities were united only by common interest and language, and tended to form tribal groups by dialect. It is estimated that they numbered at some 400,000 people when they were first encountered by Europeans. They were sedentary and agricultural, subsisting largely on manioc, maize, wild game, and honey. Equally little is known about early Guaraní society and beliefs. They practiced a form of animistic pantheism, much of which has survived in the form of numerous folklore and myths. Guarani mythology is still widespread in rural Paraguay. According to the Jesuit missionary Dobrizhoffer, they practiced cannibalism, perhaps as a funerary ritual, but later disposed of the dead in large jars placed inverted on the ground.[PARAGRAPH:2]When the Portuguese arrived in Brazil, they found that wherever they went along the vast coast of this newly discovered land, most natives spoke similar languages. Jesuit missionaries took advantage of these similarities, systematizing common standards then named línguas gerais "general languages", which were spoken in that region until the 19th century. The best known and most widely spoken of these languages was Old Tupi, a modern descendent of which is still used today by Indians around the Rio Negro region, where it is known as Nheengatu, or the "fine language". However, the Tupi family comprises also other languages.[PARAGRAPH:2]In the neighbouring Spanish colonies, Guarani, another Tupian language closely related to Old Tupi, had a similar history, but managed to resist the spread of Spanish more successfully than Tupi resisted Portuguese.

They practiced a form of animistic pantheism, much of which has survived in the form of numerous folklore and myths. Guaraní mythology is still widespread in rural Paraguay. According to the Jesuit missionary Dobrizhoffer, they practiced cannibalism, perhaps as a funerary ritual, but later disposed of the dead in large jars placed inverted on the ground.[PARAGRAPH:2]When the Portuguese arrived in Brazil, they found that wherever they went along the vast coast of this newly discovered land, most natives spoke similar languages. Jesuit missionaries took advantage of these similarities, systematizing common standards then named línguas gerais "general languages", which were spoken in that region until the 19th century. The best known and most widely spoken of these languages was Old Tupi, a modern descendent of which is still used today by Indians around the Rio Negro region, where it is known as Nheengatu [ñe-engatOO], or the "fine language". However, the Tupi family comprises also other languages.[PARAGRAPH:2]In the neighbouring Spanish colonies, Guarani, another Tupian language closely related to Old Tupi, had a similar history, but managed to resist the spread of Spanish more successfully than Tupi resisted Portuguese. Today, Guarani has 7 million speakers, and is one of the official languages of Paraguay and Bolivia. The Tupian family includes also several other languages with fewer speakers. It may be related to the Ge and Carib families in a Je-Tupi-Carib grouping.</Spanish>
