		<English>[H1]Stefan Stambolov[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Bulgarian revolutionary and Statesman[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD]January 31, 1854 - July 6, 1895 AD[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Stefan Nikolov Stambolov was a Bulgarian revolutionary and statesman. He is considered as one of the most important and popular "Founders of Modern Bulgaria" and is sometimes referred to as "the Bulgarian Bismarck".[PARAGRAPH:2]He was born in Veliko Turnovo. His education started in his home town, but he later studied in the Odessa Seminary between 1870 and 1872. Stambolov's father took part in the "Velchova Zavera" (1835) works with Captain Nikola Filipovski (1853). Stambolov himself grew up among revolutionists like Hristo Ivanov "Knigovezetza", father Mathei Preobrazhenski - Mitkaloto, Hristo Karaminkov "Buneto". He took part in all actions for political independence in the 1870s - he joined the Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee (BRCC). After the death of the founder of BRCC Vassil Levski, Stambolov was chosen as his successor. He was the leader of the unsuccessful uprising in Stara Zagora (1875) and the Turnovo revolutionary committee in the great uprising of April (1876).[PARAGRAPH:2]Stambolov was involved in the political discussions as early as the time of the first Bulgarian parliament - "The Founding Assembly" of 1879. After 1880 he became the vice-chairman and later the chairman of the Narodno Subranie (the Bulgarian parliament). For a relatively long period he was the Prime Minister of the country (1887 - 1894). He helped the Union of Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia (1885). In 1886, when pro-Russian officers staged a coup d'etat against the Bulgarian prince Alexander von Battenberg, Stambolov directed the successful counter coup d'etat. The prince, however, could not remain on the throne without the approval of the Russian emperor Alexander III and had to leave the country. Stambolov was a nationalist; as a politician, he strengthened the diplomacy of the country, its economy, and the general political power of the state. He crushed Russia's numerous attempts to overthrow the Bulgarian government and install a puppet regime. He confronted Ferdinand's intrigues (after Ferdinand succeeded Alexander Batenberg) and, as a result, he was attacked and slayed by his political enemies, led by Ferdinand in Sofia on July 3, 1895. He died three days later.[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Regency[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:2]Stefan Stambolov was twice called upon to occupy the Bulgarian throne as chief regent during two periods in its precarious history. The first was during the self-imposed exile of Prince Alexander Battenberg between 28 August 1886 and 3 September 1886 and, subsequently, during the vacancy of the throne between 7 September 1886 and 14 August 1887 following Alexander's eventual abdication.[PARAGRAPH:2]At the age of 32, Stambolov found himself in the highly-unusual position of being a minister of government, president and prince regent (a situation matched in its unusualness only, perhaps, by the election of former King II Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to the office of prime minister of Bulgaria in 2001, making him one of the few monarchs in history who regained political power through democratic election to a different office). Stambolov's style of governing during the period of his regency was observed as being increasingly authoritarian and dictatorial but, this was, to some extent, a reaction to the various threats and dangers which attached to the reality of occupying each of these positions concurrently. Indeed, the regency has been described as marking the beginning of the tragic years of Stambolov's life.[PARAGRAPH:2]According to a close friend, Stambolov was "almost inclined to resign the honours [of serving as regent], together with the dangers of his position, and retire to his beloved Turnovo" but stayed on recognizing that if he did not lead, then, in the absence of any other willing or able candidates, Bulgaria's sovereignty would likely be lost.[PARAGRAPH:2]Through Stambolov's efforts, a successor to the troubled reign of Alexander was found in Ferdinand, Prince of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, who was proclaimed Prince Regent of autonomous Bulgaria on 7 July 1887 and crowned on 14 August 1887.[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Assessment[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:2]Stambolov was the only Bulgarian politician to realize that the so-called liberation of Bulgaria was an attempt by Czarist Russia to turn Bulgaria into its protectorate. His policy was to preserve Bulgarian independence from Russian aggression. The times of his leadership were characterized by the transformation of Bulgaria from an Ottoman province into a modern European state.[PARAGRAPH:2]Stambolov took into account the need to inflame Bulgarian nationalism in Macedonia (then still under Ottoman control) to further this objective. Stambolov established close connections with the Sultan in order to enliven Bulgarian national spirit in Macedonia and to demonstrate Bulgaria's opposition to Russian-backed Greek and Serbian propaganda. Due to Stambolov's tactics, the Sultan recognized Bulgarians as the predominant peoples in Macedonia and gave a green light to the creation of strong church and cultural institutions.[PARAGRAPH:2]Stambolov negotiated loans with Western European countries in order to develop the military strength of Bulgaria. In part, this was motivatied by his desire to create a modern army which could successfully unify the nation with the support of the Bulgarian national uprising in Macedonia.[PARAGRAPH:2]His approach toward Western Europe was one of diplomatic maneuvering. He understood the interests of the Austrian empire in Macedonia and warned his diplomats accordingly. His domestic policy was distinguished by the defeat of terrorist groups sponsored by Russia, the strengthening of the rule of law, as well as by measures taken to promote rapid economic and social change, and to develop a modern army capable of protecting Bulgaria's indipendnce.[PARAGRAPH:2]Stambolov realized that only a politically, militarily and economically strong Bulgaria could ensure national unification. Stambolov mapped out the political course which turned Bulgaria into a strong regional power.</English>
