		<English>[H1]Haakon Haakonsson[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of Norway[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] 1204 - 1263[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Haakon's mother was Inga of Varteig. She claimed he was the illegitimate son of Haakon III of Norway, the leader of the birkebeiner faction in the ongoing civil war against the bagler. Haakon III had visited Varteig, in what is now Østfold  county, the previous year. He was dead by the time Haakon was born, but Inga's claim was supported by several of Haakon III's followers, and the birkebeiner recognized Haakon as a king's son.  The civil war era in Norwegian history lasted from 1130 to 1240. During this period there were several interlocked conflicts of varying scale and intensity. The background for these conflicts were the unclear Norwegian succession laws, social conditions and the struggle between different aristocratic parties and between Church and King. There were opposing factions, firstly known by varying names or no names at all, but finally condensed into the two parties birkebeiner and bagler. The rallying point regularly was a royal son, who was set up as the figurehead of the party in question, to oppose the rule of king from the contesting party. Haakon's putative father Haakon III had already sought some reconciliation with the Bagler party and with exiled bishops. His death was early and poisoning was suspected. He was not married. After his death, the bagler started another rising leading to the de facto division of the country into a bagler kingdom in the south-east, and a birkebeiner kingdom in the west and north.  Haakon was born in territory which was controlled by the Bagler faction, and his mother's claim that he was a birkebeiner royal son placed them both in a very dangerous position. When in 1206 the Bagler tried to take advantage of the situation and started hunting Haakon, a group of Birkebeiner warriors fled with the child, heading for King Inge II of Norway, the birkebeiner king in Nidaros (now Trondheim). On their way they came into a blizzard, and only the two mightiest warriors, Torstein Skevla and Skjervald Skrukka, continued on skis, carrying the child in their arms. They managed to bring the heir to safety. This event still is commemorated in one of Norway's most important annual skiing event, the Birkebeiner ski race.

The rescued child was placed under the protection of King Inge Baardsson. After King Inge's death in 1217 he, at the age of 13, was chosen king. Haakon was chosen against the candidacy of Inge's half-brother, earl Skule Baardsson. Skule, however, as earl, retained the real royal power. In connection with the dispute over the royal election, Haakon's mother Inga had to prove his parentage through a trial by ordeal in Bergen in 1218. The church at first refused to recognize him, partly on the ground of illegitimacy.

In 1223 a great meeting of all the bishops, earls, lendmenn and other prominent men was held in Bergen to finally decide on Haakon's right to the throne. The other candidates to the throne were Guttorm Ingesson, the 11-year-old illegitimate son of King Inge Baardsson; Knut Haakonson, legitimate son of earl Haakon the Crazy, who resided in Västergötland, Sweden, with his mother Kristin; earl Skule, who based his claim on being the closest living relative - a legitimate brother - of king Inge; and Sigurd Ribbung, who was at the time a captive of earl Skule. Haakon was confirmed as king of Norway, as a direct heir of King Haakon Sverresson, king Inge's predecessor. A most important factor in his victory was the fact that the church now took Haakon's side, despite his illegitimate birth. However, the Pope's dispensation for his coronation was not gained until 1247.  In 1217, Philip Simonsson, the last Bagler king, died. Speedy political and military manoeuvering by Skule Baardsson led to reconciliation between the birkebeiner and bagler, and the reunification of the kingdom. However, some discontented elements among the bagler found a new royal pretender, Sigurd Ribbung and launched a new rising in the eastern parts of the country. This was finally quashed in 1227, leaving Haakon more or less uncontested monarch.  In the earlier part of Haakon's reign much of the royal power was in the hands of Skule Baardsson. From the start of his reign, it was decided that Skule should rule one third of the kingdom, as earl, and Skule helped put down the rising of Sigurd Ribbung. But the relationship between Skule and Haakon became more and more strained as Haakon came of age, and asserted his power. As an attempt to reconcile the two, in 1225 Haakon married Skule's daughter Margrét Skúladóttir. In 1239 the conflict between the two erupted into open warfare, when Skule had himself proclaimed king in Nidaros. The rebellion ended in 1240 when Skule was put to death. The rebellion also led to the death of Snorri Sturluson. Skule's other son-in-law, the one-time claimant Knut Haakonsson, did not join the revolt, but remained loyal to king Haakon. This rebellion is generally taken to mark the end of Norway's age of civil wars.

From this time onward Haakons reign was marked by internal peace and more prosperity than Norway had known for many years. This was the start of what has traditionally been known as the golden age of the Norwegian medieval kingdom. In 1240, a group of Bjarmians told Haakon that they were refugees from the Mongols. He gave them land in Malangen. In 1247 Haakon finally achieved recognition by the pope, who sent Cardinal William of Sabina to Bergen to crown him. Abroad, Haakon mounted a campaign against the Danish province of Halland in 1256. In 1261 the Norse community in Greenland agreed to submit to the Norwegian king, and in 1262, Haakon achieved one of his long-standing ambitions when Iceland, racked by internal conflict and prompted by Haakon's Icelandic clients, did the same. The kingdom of Norway was now the largest it has ever been. In 1263 a dispute with the Scottish king concerning the Hebrides, a Norwegian possession, induced Haakon to undertake an expedition to the west of Scotland. Alexander III of Scotland had conquered the Hebrides the previous year. Haakon retook the islands with his formidable leidang  fleet, and launched some forays onto the Scottish mainland as well. A division of his army seems to have repulsed a large Scottish force at Largs  (though the later Scottish accounts claim this battle as a victory). Negotiations between the Scots and the Norwegians took place, which were purposely prolonged by the Scots, as Haakon's position would grow more difficult the longer he had to keep his fleet together so far away from home. An Irish delegation approached Haakon with an offer to provide for his fleet through the winter, if Haakon would help them against the English. Haakon seems to have been favorable to this proposition, but his men refused. Eventually the fleet retreated to the Orkney Islands for the winter.  While Haakon was wintering in the Orkney Islands and staying in the Bishop's Palace, Kirkwall, he fell ill, and died on December 16, 1263. A great part of his fleet had been scattered and destroyed by storms. Haakon was buried for the winter in St. Magnus Cathedral in Kirkwall. When spring came he was exhumed and his body taken back to Norway, where he was buried in the old cathedral in his capital, Bergen. This cathedral was demolished in 1531, the site is today marked by a memorial.  On his deathbed Haakon declared that he only knew of one son who was still alive, Magnus, who subsequently succeeded him as king.</English>

There were opposing factions, firstly known by varying names or no names at all, but finally condensed into the two parties birkebeiner and bagler. The rallying point regularly was a royal son, who was set up as the figurehead of the party in question, to oppose the rule of king from the contesting party. Haakon's putative father Haakon III had already sought some reconciliation with the Bagler party and with exiled bishops. His death was early and poisoning was suspected. He was not married. After his death, the bagler started another rising leading to the de facto division of the country into a bagler kingdom in the south-east, and a birkebeiner kingdom in the west and north.  Haakon was born in territory which was controlled by the Bagler faction, and his mother's claim that he was a birkebeiner royal son placed them both in a very dangerous position. When in 1206 the Bagler tried to take advantage of the situation and started hunting Haakon, a group of Birkebeiner warriors fled with the child, heading for King Inge II of Norway, the birkebeiner king in Nidaros (now Trondheim). On their way they came into a blizzard, and only the two mightiest warriors, Torstein Skevla and Skjervald Skrukka, continued on skis, carrying the child in their arms. They managed to bring the heir to safety. This event still is commemorated in one of Norway's most important annual skiing event, the Birkebeiner ski race.

The rescued child was placed under the protection of King Inge Baardsson. After King Inge's death in 1217 he, at the age of 13, was chosen king. Haakon was chosen against the candidacy of Inge's half-brother, earl Skule Baardsson. Skule, however, as earl, retained the real royal power. In connection with the dispute over the royal election, Haakon's mother Inga had to prove his parentage through a trial by ordeal in Bergen in 1218. The church at first refused to recognize him, partly on the ground of illegitimacy.

In 1223 a great meeting of all the bishops, earls, lendmenn and other prominent men was held in Bergen to finally decide on Haakon's right to the throne. The other candidates to the throne were Guttorm Ingesson, the 11-year-old illegitimate son of King Inge Baardsson; Knut Haakonson, legitimate son of earl Haakon the Crazy, who resided in Västergötland, Sweden, with his mother Kristin; earl Skule, who based his claim on being the closest living relative - a legitimate brother - of king Inge; and Sigurd Ribbung, who was at the time a captive of earl Skule. Haakon was confirmed as king of Norway, as a direct heir of King Haakon Sverresson, king Inge's predecessor. A most important factor in his victory was the fact that the church now took Haakon's side, despite his illegitimate birth. However, the Pope's dispensation for his coronation was not gained until 1247.  In 1217, Philip Simonsson, the last Bagler king, died. Speedy political and military manoeuvering by Skule Baardsson led to reconciliation between the birkebeiner and bagler, and the reunification of the kingdom. However, some discontented elements among the bagler found a new royal pretender, Sigurd Ribbung and launched a new rising in the eastern parts of the country. This was finally quashed in 1227, leaving Haakon more or less uncontested monarch.  In the earlier part of Haakon's reign much of the royal power was in the hands of Skule Baardsson. From the start of his reign, it was decided that Skule should rule one third of the kingdom, as earl, and Skule helped put down the rising of Sigurd Ribbung. But the relationship between Skule and Haakon became more and more strained as Haakon came of age, and asserted his power. As an attempt to reconcile the two, in 1225 Haakon married Skule's daughter Margrét Skúladóttir. In 1239 the conflict between the two erupted into open warfare, when Skule had himself proclaimed king in Nidaros. The rebellion ended in 1240 when Skule was put to death. The rebellion also led to the death of Snorri Sturluson. Skule's other son-in-law, the one-time claimant Knut Haakonsson, did not join the revolt, but remained loyal to king Haakon. This rebellion is generally taken to mark the end of Norway's age of civil wars.

From this time onward Haakons reign was marked by internal peace and more prosperity than Norway had known for many years. This was the start of what has traditionally been known as the golden age of the Norwegian medieval kingdom. In 1240, a group of Bjarmians told Haakon that they were refugees from the Mongols. He gave them land in Malangen. In 1247 Haakon finally achieved recognition by the pope, who sent Cardinal William of Sabina to Bergen to crown him. Abroad, Haakon mounted a campaign against the Danish province of Halland in 1256. In 1261 the Norse community in Greenland agreed to submit to the Norwegian king, and in 1262, Haakon achieved one of his long-standing ambitions when Iceland, racked by internal conflict and prompted by Haakon's Icelandic clients, did the same. The kingdom of Norway was now the largest it has ever been. In 1263 a dispute with the Scottish king concerning the Hebrides, a Norwegian possession, induced Haakon to undertake an expedition to the west of Scotland. Alexander III of Scotland had conquered the Hebrides the previous year. Haakon retook the islands with his formidable leidang  fleet, and launched some forays onto the Scottish mainland as well. A division of his army seems to have repulsed a large Scottish force at Largs  (though the later Scottish accounts claim this battle as a victory). Negotiations between the Scots and the Norwegians took place, which were purposely prolonged by the Scots, as Haakon's position would grow more difficult the longer he had to keep his fleet together so far away from home. An Irish delegation approached Haakon with an offer to provide for his fleet through the winter, if Haakon would help them against the English. Haakon seems to have been favorable to this proposition, but his men refused. Eventually the fleet retreated to the Orkney Islands for the winter.  While Haakon was wintering in the Orkney Islands and staying in the Bishop's Palace, Kirkwall, he fell ill, and died on December 16, 1263. A great part of his fleet had been scattered and destroyed by storms. Haakon was buried for the winter in St. Magnus Cathedral in Kirkwall. When spring came he was exhumed and his body taken back to Norway, where he was buried in the old cathedral in his capital, Bergen. This cathedral was demolished in 1531, the site is today marked by a memorial.  On his deathbed Haakon declared that he only knew of one son who was still alive, Magnus, who subsequently succeeded him as king.</Spanish>
