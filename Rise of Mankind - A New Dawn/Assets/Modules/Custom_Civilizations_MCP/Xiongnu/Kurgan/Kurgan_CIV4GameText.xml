		<English>[TAB]The Noin-Ula kurgans are located by the Selenga River in the northern Mongolia hills north of Ulan Bator. It was excavated in 1924-1925 by Pyotr Kozlov. One of Noin-Ula kurgans is notable for its rich burial of a Xiongnu ruler, Uchjulü-Chanuy. Most of the objects from Noin-Ula are now in the Hermitage Museum, while some artifacts unearthed later by Mongolian archaeologists are on display in the Mongolian National Museum, Ulan Bator. One kurgan contained a lacquer cup inscribed with the name of its Chinese maker and dated September 5, 13 AD.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Noin Ula burials consist of more than 200 large kurgans. Inside the kurgans are timber burial chambers. Noin Ula had horse burials and one tomb had especially lavish furnishings. The coffin was apparently made in China, and the interned person had many of his possessions buried with him. His horse trappings were elaborately decorated and his leather-covered saddle was threaded with black and red wool clipped to resemble velvet. Magnificent textiles included a woven wool rug lined with thin leather with purple, brown, and white felt appliqué work, and textiles of Greco-Bactrian, Parthian and Anatolian origin.[PARAGRAPH:1]Some objects are similar to the artifacts from Pazyryk in the Altay Mountains. As with the finds at Pazyryk, the Noin Ula graves had been flooded and subsequently frozen, thus preserving the organic material to an unprecedented degree. The tombs, plundered in antiquity, formed wooden burial chambers in deep shafts covered by earthen kurgans. Among the burial inventory were artifacts of the Hunnish craftsmen including weaponry, home utensils, art objects, and multiple Chinese artifacts from bronze, nephrite, lacquered wood and textiles. Many artifacts show that Huns actively participated in trade along the Great Silk Road.[PARAGRAPH:1]Among the Noin Ula art works are many imported objects and fragments of fabrics recognized as Greek. The fabric, color, weaving methods and embroidery of the cloth were similar to the cloth produced in the Greek colonies on the Black Sea coast for the Scythians, and from there they were flowing to the Huns, bringing along a knowledge about western countries. The Huns' later migration was planned and weighed: pushed from the borders of China and "Western Territory", they had to move to the borders of another agricultural culture, because isolation doomed them to poverty and obliteration.[PARAGRAPH:1]</English>
