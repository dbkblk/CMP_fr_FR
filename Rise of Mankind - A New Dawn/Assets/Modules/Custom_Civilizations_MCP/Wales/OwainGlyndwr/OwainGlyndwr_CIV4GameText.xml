		<English>[H1]Owain Glyndwr[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Prince of Wales[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD]c. 1354 - 1416[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:1][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]English Army career soldier Owain Glyndwr's family were the first North Walian aristocrats to surrender their lands to Edward I's invasion army.  Glyndwr's sense of Welsh identity was strengthened after arguments with his English neighbour and son-in-law Lord Grey. Grey won a court case against Glyndwr in relation to Henry IV's hatred of the Welsh. However, Glyndwr was able to claim his own victory when he was proclaimed Prince of Wales at his estate on September 16, 1400.  On the day of his Coronation, Glyndwr attacked Ruthin Castle with his 250 followers, rushing in when the gates were opened at dawn.  This was the first of a series of raids on Rhuddlan, Flint, Holt, Oswestry and Welshpool. Glyndwr was outlawed but many of his followers sought successfully to be pardoned.  As support for Glyndwr grew, students made violent demonstrations and exiles returned to Wales to join him. Glyndwr forged alliances with Scotland and France, captured a number of castles and held a Parliament in Machynlleth.  In Harlech he held a court and planned a future for Wales. But, by the time he occupied most of Wales everyone was terrified of him.  Glyndwr fought on until he was cornered at his last castle, Harlech. No details of the siege survive, but he escaped. His wife, two daughters and a grandchild were captured and imprisoned until their deaths in London.  Glyndwr lived his remaining years with his son-in-law Sir John Skydmore at Kenturch. In 1415, he refused the offer of a pardon. His death remains a mystery and it is still uncertain where he was buried.

Today, feelings are mixed about Glyndwr and the strategies he used. He was said to have breached rules of war and burnt down Oswestry and Handbridge, Chester, so frequently that they became known as Burnttowns.</English>
