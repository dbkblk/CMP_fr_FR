		<English>[H1]Juan Peron[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]President of Argentina[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] 1895 - 1974[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:1][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Juan Domingo Peron was an Argentine soldier and politician, elected three times as President of Argentina from 1946 to 1955 and from 1973 to 1974. Peron and his wife Eva were popular among a portion of the Argentine people, particularly because of their efforts to eliminate poverty and to dignify labour. He started the political movement known as Peronism, still popular in Argentina to this day, which professes to be a third way in between capitalism and socialism.[PARAGRAPH:1]In May 1943, as a colonel, he was a significant figure in the military coup by the GOU (United Officers' Group), a secret society, against the conservative civilian government of Ramón Castillo. Initially secretary to Secretary of War General Edelmiro Farrell, under the administration of General Pedro Ramirez, he later became the head of the then-insignificant Department of Labor. Peron's growing power and influence during the military government came from his alliance with a sector of the Argentine labor unions. [PARAGRAPH:1]The popular support gained Peron the presidency in 1946. Peron pursued social policies aimed at empowering the working class. He greatly expanded the number of unionized workers, and helped establish the powerful General Confederation of Labour (CGT), created in 1930. He called this the "third position", between capitalism and communism. Perón also pushed hard to industrialize the country; in 1947 he announced the first five-year plan to boost newly nationalized industries. His ideology would be dubbed Peronism and became a central influence in Argentine political parties.[PARAGRAPH:1]The improvement of the laborers' situation created, in the middle and high classes, a strong feeling against the new industrial workers coming from the rural areas who were treated formerly as servants. In the 1940s the middle and high class students were the first group to oppose Peronist workers, using the slogan: "peon-footwear [=espadrilles] dictatorship, NO!" ("No a la dictadura de las alpargatas"). Another famous painting revealing the strong oposition between peronists and anti-peronist appeared at the high class districts in the 1950s saying, "Long live cancer!" (Viva el cáncer!), when Eva Peron was dying because of the cancer. [PARAGRAPH:1]In contrast to his alleged right-wing tendencies, he resisted the entreaties of the military in 1943 to crack down on homosexuality. Instead he ordered the police and judiciary to let up on their gay-baiting. In addition, Perón promoted the tango, legalized prostitution, granted women's suffrage, recognized divorce, and suppressed former discrimination between first-born and later children.[PARAGRAPH:1]After a military coup, Peron went into exile in Paraguay. Later he lived in Panama, where he met nightclub bolero singer Maria Estela Martinez. Eventually settling in Madrid, Spain, he married Maria Estela Martinez, better known as Isabel, in 1961. Peronism was banned and Peronists were persecuted. Peron's third presidency was marked by an escalating conflict between his left and his right-wing supporters. This turmoil was fueled primarily by Peron's growing ties with former rival Ricardo Balbin, the conservative leader of the Radical Party (UCR); whom the Raul Alfonsin led opposition considered a right-wing radical.</English>
