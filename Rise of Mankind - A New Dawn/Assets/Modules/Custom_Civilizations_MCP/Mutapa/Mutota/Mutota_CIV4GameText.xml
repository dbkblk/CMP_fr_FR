		<English>[H1]Nyatsimba Mutota[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of Mwene Mutapa[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD]1420? - 1450 [NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]The Mutapa empire is thought to have been established by the Rozvi whose descendants include the modern-day Shona people. The founder of the ruling dynasty was Mbire, a semi-mythical potentate active in the 13th century. Mbire's purported great-great-grandson Nyatsimba was the first ruler to assume the title of the "owner of the Conquered Lands and Peoples", which became hereditary among his descendants. Nyatsimba Mutota, Chief of the Karanga Tribe of the Shonas, founded the Kingdom of Monomotapa in present day Zimbabwe and Mozambique circa 1420.[PARAGRAPH:1]After 1400 one clan of the Shona tribe, the Rozwi clan, became dominant over the others. Mutota expanded northward to the Zambezi River. This prompted him to move the Shona capital from Great Zimbabwe to Khami in 1440; Khami was also closer to the gold deposits that were still being worked. Because he was successful in his military endeavors, the Shona began calling him Mwene Mutapa, meaning "Great Plunderer." Ultimately, this became the name of his kingdom, too; the Portuguese spelled it Monomotapa.</English>
