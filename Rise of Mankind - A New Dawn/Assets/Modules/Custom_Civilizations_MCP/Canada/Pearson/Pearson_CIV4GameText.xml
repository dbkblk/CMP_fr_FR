        <English>[H1]Lester B. Pearson[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Prime Minister of Canada[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] 1897 - 1972[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]The Right Honourable Lester Bowles "Mike" Pearson was a Canadian statesman, diplomat and politician who was made a Nobel Laureate in 1957 and served as the fourteenth Prime Minister of Canada from April 22, 1963, to April 20, 1968.[PARAGRAPH:1]During his time as Prime Minister, Pearson's minority government introduced universal health care, student loans, bilingualism, the Canada Pension Plan, and Canada's flag. Combined with his groundbreaking work at the United Nations, and in international diplomacy, Pearson can safely be regarded as one of the most influential Canadians of the twentieth century.[PARAGRAPH:1]After teaching university, he embarked on a career in the Department of External Affairs. He had a distinguished career as a diplomat, including playing an important part in founding both the United Nations and NATO. During World War II, he once served as a courier with the codename "Mike". He was appointed Secretary of State for External Affairs in the government of Liberal Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent in 1948. Pearson won a seat in the Canadian House of Commons, for the federal riding of Algoma East shortly afterward. In 1957, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his role in defusing the Suez Crisis through the United Nations. The selection committee claimed that Pearson had "saved the world". The United Nations Peacekeeping Force was Pearson's creation, and he is considered the father of the modern concept of peacekeeping.[PARAGRAPH:1]Pearson led the Liberals to a minority government in the 1963 general election, and became prime minister. He had campaigned during the election promising "60 Days of Decision" and support for the Bomarc missile program.[PARAGRAPH:1]Pearson never had a majority in the Canadian House of Commons, but he introduced important social programs (including universal health care, the Canada Pension Plan, and Canada Student Loans), and the Maple Leaf Flag. Pearson's government instituted much of the modern welfare state in Canada, due in part to support for his minority government in the House of Commons from the New Democratic Party, led by Tommy Douglas. His actions included instituting the 40-hour work week, 2 weeks vacation time, and a new minimum wage.[PARAGRAPH:1]It should be noted that such policies did not prevent a strong economy. Pearson signed the Canada-United States Automotive Agreement (or Auto Pact) in January of 1965, and unemployment fell to its lowest rate in over a decade.[PARAGRAPH:1]Pearson also started a number of Royal Commissions, including one on the status of women and another on bilingualism. They instituted changes that helped create legal equality for women, and brought official bilingualism into being. After Pearson, French was made an official language, and the Canadian government would provide services in both. Pearson himself had hoped that he would be the last unilingual Prime Minister of Canada, and indeed fluency in both English and French became an unofficial requirement for Prime Ministeral candidates after Pearson left office.[PARAGRAPH:1]Pearson was also remarkable for instituting the world's first race-free immigration system, throwing out previous ones that had discriminated against certain people, such as Jews and the Chinese. His points-based system encouraged immigration to Canada, and a similar system is still in place today. Pearson also oversaw Canada's centennial celebrations in 1967 before retiring. The Canadian news agency, Canadian Press, named him "Newsmaker of the Year" that year, citing his leadership during the centennial celebrations, which brought the Centennial Flame on Parliament Hill.</English>
