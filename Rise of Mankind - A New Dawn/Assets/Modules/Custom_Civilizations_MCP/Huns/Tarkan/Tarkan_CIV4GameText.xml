		<English>[TAB]These light hussars were ideal for reconnaissance and raiding sources of fodder and provisions in advance of the army. In battle, they were used in such light cavalry roles as harassing enemy skirmishers, overrunning cannon positions, and pursuing fleeing troops. Tarkans also had a reputation for being the dashing, if unruly, adventurers of the army. The traditional image of the tarkan is of a reckless, hard-drinking, hard-swearing, womanising, moustachioed swashbuckler. Less romantically, tarkans were also known (and feared) for their poor treatment of local civilians. In addition to commandeering local food-stocks for the army, hussars were known to also use the opportunity for personal looting and pillaging.</English>
