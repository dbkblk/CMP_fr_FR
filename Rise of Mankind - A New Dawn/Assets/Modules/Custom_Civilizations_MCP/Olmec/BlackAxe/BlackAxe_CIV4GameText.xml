		<English>[TAB]Obsidian was used by American Indians and many other primitive peoples for weapons, implements, tools, and ornaments and by the ancient Aztecs, Olmecs and Greeks for mirrors. Because of its conchoidal fracture (smooth curved surfaces and sharp edges), the sharpest stone artifacts were fashioned from obsidian; some of these, mostly arrowheads, have been dated by means of the hydration rinds that form on. Meso-American cultures often employed jade, flint and obsidian in the crafting of items of warfare, ritual and ceremony. The Omlecs used obsidian to create black axes, often polished with flint handles.</English>
