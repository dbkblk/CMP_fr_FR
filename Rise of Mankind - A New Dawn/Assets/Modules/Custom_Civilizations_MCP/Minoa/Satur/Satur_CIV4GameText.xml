		<English>[H1]Satur I The Great[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of Minoan Empire[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] c.1725 -1675 BC [PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]What little we know about the Minoan kings from later Greek tradition reveals that they resembled the Egyptian pharaohs in several fundamental ways. The two Minoan rulers known by name, Minos of Knossos and Rhadamanthys of Phaistos, were of divine descent (as sons of Zeus). Minos established the first laws (Laws of Minos) on Crete and acted as judge of the living and dead. Renowned for his justice, Rhadamanthys ruled as king of the dead in the Elysion Fields. The Minoan rulers were divine, established a system of law and order, and were known for their social justice - characteristics that find obvious parallels in the pharaohs of the Middle Kingdom. It seems possible therefore that the first Minoan rulers modeled themselves to some extent on their royal Egyptian counterparts.[PARAGRAPH:2]Kronos (c.1715-1675 BC) known by the Romans as Saturn was probably the Cretan king Satur who ruled at Knossos some time between 1725 and 1675 BC according to Linear A inscriptions. Not much is known of King Satur I at this time other than he is the first named king of the Minoan civilization.</English>
