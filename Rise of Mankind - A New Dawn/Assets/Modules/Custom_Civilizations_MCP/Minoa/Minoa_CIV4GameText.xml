Previously thought to exist only in Greek myths, the Minoans were discovered in 1900 by Sir Arthur Evans, a British archaeologist who was searching for King Minos' tomb at the site of Knossos on Crete.

They are also well known for their maze-like palaces, which first appeared around 2000 BC.

In particular, Minoans seem to have had a love of nature. Birds, cats, marine life, flowers, plants, and especially bulls are common images in frescos and on pottery. Women are also very popular in works of Minoan art and their pale skin distinguishes them from men, who were represented with darker skin tones.[PARAGRAPH:1:2]The Minoans are regarded as a peaceful, seafaring people who relied on overseas trade throughout the Mediterranean. Hence, the decline and eventual demise of the Minoan civilization still remains a mystery to archaeologists and historians. Common theories include a massive volcanic eruption on the island of Thera or Mycenaean conquest of Crete.[PARAGRAPH:1:2](Ancient History Encyclopedia:Minoan)</English>

"Minos" might be actually a title, as such titles were often used for kings. Historians have noted the similarity in the names of Menes of Egypt, Mannus of Germany, Manu of India and so on.[PARAGRAPH:1]Minos reigned over Crete and the Islands of the Aegean Sea three generations before the Trojan War. He lived at Knossos for periods of nine years, where he received instructions from Zeus. He was the author of Cretan constitution and the founder of its naval supremacy. He is also in Attic tradition and on the Athenian stage, a cruel tyrant, the heartless exactor of the tribute of Athenian youths to feed the Minotaur.[PARAGRAPH:1]To explain how Minos governed the island over so many generations, it have been assumed that Minos actually were two kings. The first Minos was the son of Zeus and were the 'good' king Minos, and he were held in such esteem by the Olympian gods that, after he died, he were made on of the three 'Judges of the Dead' in the Greek underworld. The wife of 'Minos I' is said to be a nymph and he had a single son named Lycastus, his successor as king of Crete. Lycastus had a son named Minos after his grandfather, and this is 'Minos II', the 'bad' king Minos, and were a far more colorful character than his father and grandfather. It would be of this Minos we owe the myths of Theseus, the Minotaur and the Labyrinth. Unlike his grandfather, 'Minos II' fathered numerous children, including Androgeus, Catreus and Deucalion. He was the grandfather of King Idomeneus who led the Cretans to the Trojan War.[PARAGRAPH:1]Doubtless there is a considerable historical element in the legend, perhaps in the Phoenician origin of Europa; it is possible that not only Athens, but also Mycenae itself, were once culturally bound to the kings of Knossos, as Minoan object appear at Mycenaean sites.[PARAGRAPH:1]Minos himself is said to have died in Sicily, where he was killed by the daughter of Cocalus, king of Agrigentum, who poured boiling water over him while he was taking a bath. Subsequently his remains were sent back to the Cretans, who placed them in a sarcophagus, on which was inscribed: "The tomb of Minos, the son of Zeus."[PARAGRAPH:1]The earlier legends of king Minos pictures him as a beneficent ruler, legislator and suppressor of piracy. His constitution is said to have formed the basis of that of Lycurgus for Sparta. According to these legends, he were made a judge of the underworld after his death.[PARAGRAPH:1](Wikipedia:Minos)</English>

		<English>[TAB]The Minoans are perhaps most known for their huge palaces (Anaktoras). While it was believed that all of these palaces were built in the Middle Minoan period around 2000 BC, it have later been proved that this is not the case and that the palace at Malia were built as early as the third millennium BC in the Early Minoan period. The three main old palaces were the ones at Malia, Knossos and Phaistos. These palaces had a number of functions, such as centers of government, administrative offices, shrines, workshops, and storage spaces. This have created a discussion if it really is right to call these buildings palaces, and the term court building have been suggested instead. However, the original term is probably too well entrenched to be replaced.[PARAGRAPH:1]Often the conventions of better-known, younger palaces have been used to reconstruct older ones, but this practice may be obscuring fundamental functional differences. Most older palaces had only one story and no representative facades. They were U-shaped, with a big central court, and generally were smaller than later palaces. Late palaces are characterised by multi-story buildings. The west facades had sandstone ashlar masonry. Knossos is the best-known example. See Knossos. Further building conventions could include storage magazines, a north-south orientation, a pillar room, a Minoan Hall system, a western court, and pier-and-door entrance ways. Palatial architecture in the First Palace Period is identified by its 'square within a square' style, whilst later, Second Palace Period constructions incorporated more internal divisions and corridors.[PARAGRAPH:1]It is a common architectural standard among the Middle Minoan 'palaces' that they are aligned with their surrounding topography. The MM palatial structure of Phaistos appears to align with Mount Ida, whilst Knossos is aligned with Juktas. These are oriented along a north-south axis. One suggested reason for this is the ritual significance of the mountain, where a number of Peak Sanctuaries have been excavated like Petsophas. The material record for these sites show clusters of clay figurines and evidence of animal sacrifice.[PARAGRAPH:1](Wikipedia: Minoan Civilization)</English>
