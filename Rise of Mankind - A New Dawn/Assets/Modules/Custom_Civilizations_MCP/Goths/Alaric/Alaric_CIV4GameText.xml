		<English>[H1]Alaric I[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of the Visigoths[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] c.370 - 410 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]After serving in the campaigns of Emperor Theodosius I against the western usurper Eugenius in 394, the Visigothic chieftain Alaric revolted, displeased because he had not received sufficient reward. Between 395 and 397, he led the Visigoths in devastating Thrace and Greece, sacking several cities including Corinth and Sparta. He invaded Italy in 401 and besieged the Western Roman emperor Flavius Honorius (395-423) in Milan. In 402, after being defeated at Pollentia and Verona by the Western Empire general Stilicho, he moved into the province of Noricum, just north of Italy.[PARAGRAPH:1]Following Stilicho's murder in 408, Alaric invaded Italy after Honorius refused to pay him for past services. A siege of Rome was alternately lifted and renewed. Finally, on August 24, 410, after being joined by his relative Athaulf, Alaric captured Rome. The city was sacked for three days; churches were generally left untouched. The damage was more psychological than material. For the first time in 800 years, Rome had fallen. No longer could it be called "Unconquered Rome."[PARAGRAPH:1]Alaric then traveled south, hoping to cross to Sicily, but after the Gothic fleet was wrecked, he turned back north. On this journey, he became ill and died at Cosentia in southern Italy.[PARAGRAPH:1]It is said that Alaric was buried with his treasures in the bed of the Busento River, which was temporarily diverted from its course. That the secret of his burial place might be kept, the slaves employed in the labor were killed.[PARAGRAPH:1]</English>
