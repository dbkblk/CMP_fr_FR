		<English>[H1]Mohammad Ali Jinnah[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Governor-General of Pakistan[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD]1876 - 1948[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]The eldest son of a hide merchant, Jinnah was educated at the Sind Madrassa and Lincoln's Inn, London, where he qualified as a barrister. The future founder of Pakistan was first known as the ambassador of Hindu-Muslim unity. Indeed Jinnah only resigned from Congress in 1920 when he became disillusioned with the violence and communal passions unleashed by Gandhi's Congress-Khilafat civil disobedience campaigns. The division widened in 1928 when the Nehru Report rejected Jinnah's "fourteen points" constitutional proposals.  During 1921 – 35, Jinnah's political career was in the doldrums. He returned to India in October 1935 after a five-year British exile to reorganize the Muslim League. It nevertheless lost heavily in the 1937 provincial elections. The Congress ministries' insensitivity to Muslim demands rescued it from oblivion, although Jinnah's leadership was equally crucial to its dramatic transformation. From 1940 onwards, he propounded the two-nation theory justification for Pakistan and increasingly embodied the aspirations of the Indian Muslim community which acclaimed him as the Quaid-i-Azam, the great leader. Within the fractious politics of the Muslim League, he exerted an unquestioned moral authority which underpinned his formal power as President. Simultaneously he deployed his forensic skills in the complex constitutional negotiations with the British and the Congress.  Jinnah's successful claim to be the sole spokesman of Muslim India at the July 1945 Simla conference greatly strengthened the Pakistan demand. During 1946 – 7, however, he suffered a series of reversals as the Muslim League lost its wartime bargaining power. He had to abandon his strictly constitutional approach to politics, but the resulting communal riots threatened civil war. Agreement for Partition was finally reached on 3 June 1947: the Pakistan which emerged was not of the full six Muslim provinces of Jinnah's dreams, but a moth-eaten country shorn of West Bengal and East Punjab. Mass migrations and massacres accompanied the Punjab's partition. The refugee crisis increased Pakistan's formidable security and administrative problems.  Jinnah, who was both Pakistan's Governor-General and Constituent Assembly President, assumed much of the burden for laying the state's foundations. He was by now 70 and appeared frailer and more emaciated than ever. It remains doubtful however whether if he had lived longer than September 1948, Pakistan could have avoided its growing crisis of governability.  Jinnah is still revered as Pakistan's founding father. Islamists improbably and secularists more soundly have attempted to claim his mantle. Recent revisionist scholarship, however, has speculated that Partition was the unintended consequence of his trumpeting the Pakistan demand as a bargaining counter for power in a united India.</English>
