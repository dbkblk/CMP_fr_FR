		<English>[TAB]Ayastigi is the Cherokee word for Fighting Man or Warrior. The Cherokee warpath was made up of many trails that had been carved into the mountains from thousands of years of use by the warriors going to war. They would travel for thousands of miles to make war with their cousins of the Iroquois Nation, and other northern tribes.  Give the ayastigi a direction and a leader and they would follow it. When the war chief struck the atadedawasdodi (war pole), all ayastigi who wished to follow the chief gathered their war gear and struck out on one of their favorite "sports." The Cherokee were not a brutal tribe of war people.  They were just made up of warriors who would go to war over the smallest wrong done to them or one of their own. They were respected and feared by all. The war cry of the Cherokee brought fear through out the mountains when they came calling.</English>
