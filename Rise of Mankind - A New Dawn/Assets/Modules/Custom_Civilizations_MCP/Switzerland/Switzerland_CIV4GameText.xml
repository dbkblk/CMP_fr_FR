		<English>[TAB]The Swiss Confederation or Switzerland (Latin: Confoederatio Helvetica, German Schweiz, French Suisse, Italian Svizzera) is a landlocked Alpine country in Central Europe with a strong economy in finance and banking. Switzerland shares borders with Germany, France, Italy, Austria and Liechtenstein. Switzerland is a Federal Republic and has a long and strong tradition of political and military neutrality. This background allows Switzerland various international co-operations and organizations.[PARAGRAPH:2]Confoederatio Helvetica is the country's official Latin name. The use of Latin avoids having to favor one of the four official languages. The abbreviation (CH) is similarly used. The Latin title Confoederatio Helvetica means Helvetic Confederation. The titles commonly used in French, Italian and Romansh translate as Swiss Confederation, while the German name of Schweizerische Eidgenossenschaft translates roughly as "Swiss Oath Fellowship" or "Swiss Commonwealth of the Covenant".</English>
