		<English>[H1]Toussaint L'ouverture[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Governor of Haiti[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD]1743 - 1803[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]François-Dominique Toussaint L'ouverture was a leader of the Haitian Revolution. Born in Saint Domingue, in a long struggle for independence Toussaint led enslaved Africans to victory over Europeans, abolished slavery, and secured native control over the colony in 1797 while nominally governor of the colony. He expelled the French commissioner Léger-Félicité Sonthonax, as well as the British armies; invaded Santo Domingo to free the slaves there; and wrote a constitution naming himself governor-for-life that established a new polity for the colony.[PARAGRAPH:1]Especially between the years 1800 and 1802, Toussaint L'ouverture tried to rebuild the collapsed economy of Haiti and reestablish commercial contacts with the United States and Great Britain. His rule permitted the colony a taste of freedom which, after his death in exile, was gradually destroyed during the successive reigns of a series of despots. Translated from French, his name means "the awakening of all saints" or "all souls rising". His last words were to his son in France, "My boy, you will one day go back to St. Domingo; forget that France murdered your father."[PARAGRAPH:1]Toussaint L'Ouverture was born into slavery in the Plaine du Nord of what was then Saint-Domingue. He was born on the Bréda plantation of Bayon de Libertat, near Cap Français. Tradition says that his father was an African named Gaou-Guinou and probably a member of the Arada ethnic group. Toussaint Breda was lucky enough to be educated and to be literate. He read widely in French literature of the Enlightenment. He worked as a carriage driver and horse trainer on the plantation. His master freed him at age 33, when Toussaint married Suzanne. He was a fervent Catholic, and a member of high degree of the Masonic Lodge of Saint-Domingue. In 1791 slaves in the Plaine du Nord rose in rebellion. Different forces coalesced under different leaders. Toussaint served with other leaders and rose in responsibility. On April 4, 1792, the French Legislative Assembly extended full rights of citizenship to free people of color or mulattoes (gens de couleur libres) and free blacks. In Saint-Domingue, this policy was resisted by many white colonists, although France sent three Commissioners to enforce it.[PARAGRAPH:1]As unrest and racial war continued to disrupt Saint-Domingue's institutions, Toussaint joined the Spanish army of Santo Domingo to find a way to end slavery. In August Sonthonax proclaimed emancipation for slaves in the north, where Toussaint and his allies were fighting; his fellow commissioners announced emancipation of slaves in the West and South, but the invasion by British troops in September overshadowed these changes. In 1793 Toussaint adopted as a surname his nickname of Louverture and used that as his full signature from then on.[PARAGRAPH:1]By early 1794 Toussaint Louverture was able to organize 4,000 blacks (with some white and mulatto officers) into a band of loyal guerrilla troops, as he was a gifted, although untrained, leader and military strategist, and he used elements of western discipline for his troops. It was not until February 1794 that the French Convention formally abolished slavery. Toussaint negotiated with General Laveaux and changed sides in May 1794. He then fought against the Spanish, recovering all the forts of the Cordon de L'Ouest in less than two weeks and "delivering" the North to the French Republic. He also fought against the English.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1801 the Spanish capitulated to Toussaint Louverture, ceding the remainder of the island to his forces. He proclaimed the abolition of slavery in Santo Domingo. After this in July he proclaimed a new constitution which named him governor for life.</English>
