		<English>[TAB]The Congo Empire represents a variety of central African empires that flourished in the pre-Colonial period between 1400 and 1900.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Kingdom of Kongo (1400-1888) was an African kingdom located in west central Africa in what are now northern Angola, Cabinda, Republic of the Congo, and the western portion of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. At its greatest extent, it reached from the Atlantic Ocean in the west to the Kwango River in the east, and from the Congo River in the north to the Kwanza River in the south. The kingdom consisted of several core provinces ruled by a monarch, the Manikongo (sixteenth century spelling of 'Mwene Kongo) of the Bakongo (Kongo peoples, also known as the Essikongo), but its sphere of influence extended to the neighboring states such as Ngoyo, Kakongo, Ndongo and Matamba as well. People speaking ancient versions of Kikongo probably arrived in the region from the north as part of the larger Bantu migration. They were practicing agriculture by at least 1000 BC, and working iron by at least 400 BC, though both these dates may be pushed back by more archaeological work.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Luba Empire (1585-1889) was a pre-colonial Central African state, which arose in the marshy grasslands of the Upemba depression in what is now southern Democratic Republic of Congo. The Luba Empire was founded by King Kongolo around 1585. His nephew and immediate, Kalala Ilunga, expanded the Empire over the upper left bank territories of the Lualaba River. At its peak, the state had about a million people paying tribute to its king. The Luba Empire's success was due in large part to its development of a form of a government durable enough to withstand the disruptions of succession disputes and flexible enough to incorporate foreign leaders and governments. The Luba model of governing was so successful, it was adopted by the Lunda and spread throughout the region that is today northern Angola, northwestern Zambia, and southern Democratic Republic of Congo.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Lunda Empire or Kingdom arose in the 17th century in what is now DR Congo when Ilunga Tshibinda left the Luba kingdom of his brother and married a princess from an area to the south. Their son, Mwaant Yav or Mwata Yamvo formed the central Lunda kingdom with a population of about 175,000 and became its ruler from 1660 to 1665. His title and name was passed to his descendants and successors as rulers of the kingdom. The Lunda people were able to settle and colonialize other areas and tribes, thus extending their empire to include eastern Angola, north-western Zambia and southwest Katanga Province of DR Congo.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Kuba Kingdom (1625-1900) was a pre-colonial Central African state surrounded by the Sankuru, Lulua and Kasai rivers in the southeast of what is today the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire). The kingdom began as a conglomeration of several chiefdoms of various tribes and ethnic groups with no real central authority. In approximately 1625, an individual from outside the area known as Shyaam a-Mbul a Ngoong-Shyaam usurped one of the area rulers and united all the chiefdoms under his leadership. The Kuba Kingdom reached its apex during the mid 19th century. Europeans first reached the area in 1884. Because of their relative isolation, the kingdom was not as affected by the slave trade as the Kongo or Ndongo kingdoms on the coast. Toward the end of the 19th century, the kingdom was invaded by the Nsapo people. The weakened Kingdom never recovered and fractured into chiefdoms once again by the time of the Belgian Protectorate.</English>
