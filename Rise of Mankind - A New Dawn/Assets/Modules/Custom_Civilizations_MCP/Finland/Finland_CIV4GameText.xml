		<English>[TAB]According to archaeological evidence, the area now comprising Finland was first settled around 8500 BC during the Stone Age as the ice shield of the last ice age receded. The earliest people were probably hunter-gatherers, living primarily off what the tundra and sea could offer. Pottery is known from around 5300 BC (see Comb Ceramic Culture). The existence of an extensive exchange system during the mesolithic is indicated by the spread of asbestos and soapstone from eastern Finland, and by finds of flint from southern Scandinavia and Russia and slate from Lake Onega and northern Scandinavia. It has been postulated and held probable that the speakers of the Finno-Ugric language arrived in the area during the Stone Age, and were possibly even among the first Mesolithic settlers [1]. The arrival of the Battle-Axe Culture (or Cord-Ceramic Culture) in southern coastal Finland around 3200 BC may have coincided with the start of agriculture. However, the earliest certain records of agriculture are from the late 3rd millennium BC Hunting and fishing continued to be important parts of the subsistence economy, especially in the northern and eastern parts of the country.[PARAGRAPH:2]The beginning of Finland's nearly 700-year association with the Kingdom of Sweden is traditionally connected with the year 1154 and the hypothesized introduction of Christianity by Sweden's King Erik. However, archaeological evidence points to prior Christian influences in south-western and south-eastern Finland and include both western and eastern Christian artefacts. Historically (more documented), the union began upon Birger Jarl's expedition to Finland in 1249. Swedish became the dominant language of administration and education; Finnish chiefly a language for the peasantry, clergy and local courts in predominantly Finnish-speaking areas.[PARAGRAPH:2]On March 29, 1809, after being conquered by the armies of Russian Emperor Alexander I, Finland became an autonomous Grand Duchy under the Russian Empire until the end of 1917. During this time, Finnish started gaining recognition by both the imperial court and the governing bodies, first probably to sever the cultural and emotional ties with Sweden and thereafter, from the 1860s onwards, as a result of a strong nationalist movement, known as the Fennoman movement. Milestones included the publication of what would become Finland's national epic, the Kalevala, in 1835; and the Finnish language achieving equal legal status with Swedish in 1892.[PARAGRAPH:2]During World War II, Finland fought the Soviet Union twice: in the Winter War of 1939-1940 and in the Continuation War of 1941-1944 in accordance with Operation Barbarossa in which Germany invaded the Soviet Union. This was followed by the Lapland War of 1944-1945, when Finland forced the Germans out of northern Finland.[PARAGRAPH:2]Treaties signed in 1947 and 1948 with the Soviet Union included obligations, restraints, and reparations on Finland vis-à-vis the Soviet Union as well as further Finnish territorial concessions (cf. the Moscow Peace Treaty of 1940). Finland ceded most of Finnish Karelia, Salla, and Petsamo, which amounted to 10% of land area, 20% of industrial capacity and 400,000 evacuees. The reparations to the Soviet Union forced Finland to transform itself from a primarily agrarian economy to an industrialised one. Nevertheless, most trade was with other Western countries. Even after reparations were fulfilled, Finland continued to trade with the Soviet Union in the framework of bilateral trade. (Russia has assumed a large part of the Soviet national debt which is slowly being remunerated in raw materials and electricity).[PARAGRAPH:2]The post-war era was a period of rapid economic growth and increasing wealth and stability for Finland. In all, the war-ravaged agrarian country was transformed into a technologically advanced market economy with a sophisticated social welfare system. When the Soviet Union fell in 1991, the bilateral trade disappeared overnight, and Finland was simultaneously hit by a "home-cooked" severe recession. This left a mass unemployment problem, but the economy survived and began growing at a high rate after the recession. Finland joined the European Union in 1995, where she is an advocate of federalism contrary to the other Nordic countries that are predominantly supportive of confederalism.</English>
