		<English>[H1]Helen Clark[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Prime Minister of New Zealand[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] 1950 - [NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Clark grew up as the eldest of four daughters of a Waikato farming family. Her mother, Margaret, worked as a primary-school teacher and her father, George, was a farmer who supported the National Party at the 1981 election. Clark studied at Te Pahu Primary School, at Epsom Girls' Grammar School in Auckland and at the University of Auckland, where she majored in politics and graduated with a MA (Honours) in 1974. Her thesis research focused on rural political behaviour and representation.[PARAGRAPH:1]When the New Zealand Labour Party came into office as part of a coalition following the 1999 election, Clark became the second female Prime Minister of New Zealand and the first to have won office at an election. (The previous Prime Minister, Jenny Shipley took office as the result of a mid-term party leadership challenge.) During her term in office, a number of prominent offices have been held by females - such as the Queen, Governor-General, Speaker of the House of Representatives and Chief Justice.[PARAGRAPH:1]Clark has held the positions of Prime Minister and of Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage from 1999 until the present. She also has ministerial responsibility for the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service and for Ministerial Services.[PARAGRAPH:1]Clark's government has brought in significant changes to the welfare system, such as child tax credits in the Working for Families package. Her government has also changed industrial-relations law and raised the minimum wage six times in as many years. Changes have also occurred in tertiary-education financing, with the abolition of interest on student-loans — firstly for those currently studying, then extended to all borrowers living in New Zealand. Other changes introduced during Clark's term in office include legal provision for civil unions, the introduction of 14 weeks' paid parental leave, and the Property (Relationships) Act.[PARAGRAPH:1]Even though some commentators saw stable government within the relatively new MMP electoral system as unlikely, Clark's supporters credit her with maintaining two terms of stable MMP government, as well as being able to form the current government given the close election result. In 2005, Forbes ranked Clark as number 24 of "The 100 Most Powerful Women" in the world.</English>
