		<English>[TAB]The Vedic civilization is the culture associated with the people who composed the religious texts called the Vedas, in the Indian subcontinent. It stretched from what is today Punjab in India and Pakistan, NWFP (Pakistan) and most of northern India. Mainstream scholarship places the Vedic civilization into the 2nd and 1st millennia BC. Hindu traditions suggest dates as early as the 6th millennium BC and a spread of the hyperpower-style Vedic culture. The use of Vedic Sanskrit and the Shrauta tradition continued up to the 6th century BC, when the culture began to be transformed into classical forms of Hinduism. This time period in the history of India is known as the Vedic period or Vedic age. Its early phase saw the formation of various kingdoms of ancient India. In its late phase (from ca. 700 BC), it saw the rise of the Mahajanapadas, and was succeeded by the golden age of Hinduism and classical Sanskrit literature, the Maurya Empire (from ca. 320 BC) and the Middle kingdoms of India.[PARAGRAPH:2]The origin of the Vedic civilization and its relation to the Indus Valley civilization, Indo-Aryan migration and Gandhara Grave culture related cultures remains controversial and politically charged in Indian society, often leading to disputes on the history of Vedic culture. The Rigveda is primarily a collection of religious hymns, and allusions to, but not explanation of, various myths and stories, mainly in the younger books 1 and 10. The oldest hymns, probably in books 2-7, although some people hold book 9, the Soma Mandala, to be even more ancient, contain many elements inherited from pre-Vedic, common Indo-Iranian society. Therefore, it is difficult to define the precise beginning of the "Rigvedic period", as it emerges seamlessly from the era preceding it. Also, due to the nomadic nature of the society described, it cannot be localized, and in its earliest phase describes tribes that were essentially on the move.[PARAGRAPH:2]Rig Vedic society was characterized by a rural lifestyle, with cattle rearing being the chief occupation. Cattle and cows were held in high esteem and frequently appear in Rigvedic hymns; goddesses were often compared to cows, and gods to bulls. Agriculture grew more prominent with time as the community settled down. Money was unknown, and bartering with cattle and other valuables replaced financial commerce.[PARAGRAPH:2]Families were patrilineal, and people prayed for abundance of sons. Society was strictly organized in a system of varna (to be distinguished from caste or colour, it pertained to the occupation of the respective people). The four major varnas were Brahmin (the priests and learned people), Kshatriya (kings and warriors), Vaishya (traders and merchants) and Shudra (labourers and workers). Those who are outside these caste structure are known as adivasis.[PARAGRAPH:2]The transition from the early to the later Vedic period was marked by the emergence of agriculture as the dominant economic activity and a corresponding decline in the significance of cattle rearing. Several changes went hand in hand with this. For instance, several large kingdoms arose because of the increasing importance of land and its protection.
